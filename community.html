            <p><b>Mulanay, Quezon Province</b><br>Community based monitoring system (CBMS) 2014 of Mulanay, Quezon showed that 83% of the household do not have access to safe water supply. In this regard, the Chemical Engineering Faculty of DLSU teamed up with the Civil Engineering Faculty and Behavioral Sciences Faculty, the Polytechnic University of the Philippines Mulanay (PUP Mulanay) and the local government of Mulanay to address this issue.</p>
            <p>The community engagement entailed an integrated water management system installed and demonstrated in:</p>

            <h3>2016-2019</h3>
            <p><b>Philippine Science High Sschool – Summer Internship Program (PSHS-SIP)</b><br>The Department of Chemical Engineering participated in the Philippine Science High School system summer internship program. The department served as a host to up to 39 year 10 and 11 Philippine Science students from different campuses across the Philippines (Bicol Region, Cordillera Administrative Region, Central Luzon, Central Mindanao, Cagayan Valley, Central Visayas, Ilocos Region, Main Campus, Southern Mindanao and Western Visayas) per year from 2016-2019. The goal of the program is to immerse the HS students to the research practice in a university setting with research advisers (DLSU ChE professors). All the students took and passed the Laboratory safety seminar and quiz administered by Dr. Luis F. Razon. Each group conducted some industrial chemistry experiments “Nature’s Kitchen” (given by the Chemical Engineering Society). As a culminating activity of the SIP, each group (composed of 3 members per group) presented their research proposal. All students received certificates for passing the Laboratory Safety Quiz, and also for participating in the Research Colloquium. Top three presenters were also recognized and given some prizes.</p>
