            <h2>Assessment and Accreditation</h2>
            <p class="just">The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) has granted autonomous status to De La Salle University (DLSU) for a period of five (5) years from September 2021 to May 2025 (per CHED Memorandum Order 07, series 2021). De La Salle University commits to continuous quality improvement by subjecting itself regularly to external accreditation and assessment by national and international organizations. These visits cover both institution-wide exercises and assessments of individual academic programs. DLSU has been granted Institutional Accreditation status by the Federation of Accrediting Agencies of the Philippines (FAAP) for having demonstrated the highest standards of instruction, research, and community engagement and having developed wide networks and linkages with other educational institutions.</p>
            <p class="just">DLSU’s undergraduate programs have achieved the highest accreditation of Level IV and the postgraduate programs of Br. Andrew Gonzalez College of Education, College of Liberal Arts and College of Science have also been granted Level III status. While the Level IV status of the applicant programs lapsed in 2018, these programs were granted a five-year re-accreditation until 2024.</p>
            <p class="just">Following an outcomes-based and typology-based national quality assurance process by the Philippine Commission on Higher Education (CHED), DLSU has been granted autonomous status from April 1, 2016 to May 31, 2021 (per CHED Memorandum Order 20, series 2016).  CHED has further designated 14 academic programs of DLSU as Centers of Excellence (COEs) to recognize units “which continuously demonstrate excellent performance in the areas of instruction, research and publication, extension and linkages and institutional qualifications.” An additional five academic programs have been named as Centers of Development (CODs) or units “that demonstrate potential for becoming a COE.”</p>
            <p class="just">Since regional program assessments began in 2007, half of DLSU’s 36 academic departments have been visited by international teams from the ASEAN University Network (AUN-QA); DLSU was also granted the AUN quality mark at the institutional level in 2017. Its Engineering programs received accreditation in 2019 from the Accrediting Body for Engineering and Technology (ABET) and the Philippine Technological Council (PTC-ACBET).</p>
            <p class="just">In 2018, DLSU became the first Philippine private institution ranked within the research-intensive Times Higher Education World University Rankings. It remains the top-ranked Philippine institution in Education (301-400), according to THE’s 2023 Subject Rankings.</p>
